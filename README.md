### ES Module Structure

The codebase supports both traditional script loading and ES modules:

**Traditional (default):** `game.js` is a self-contained file loaded directly via `<script>` tag.

**ES Modules (optional):** The `js/` folder contains modular components:
- `state.js` - Central `gameState` object
- `constants.js` - Game data (`DEPARTMENTS`, `UPGRADES`, `ACHIEVEMENTS`, etc.)
- `utils.js` - Helper functions (`formatNumber`, `escapeHtml`, etc.)
- `main.js` - Entry point that re-exports all modules

```javascript
// ES Module usage example:
import { gameState, DEPARTMENTS, formatNumber } from './js/main.js';
```

## 🎨 Game Mechanics

### Resources
- **Chaos Points**: Main currency, earned by clicking and from departments
- **Doom Energy**: Passive bonus that generates chaos over time
- **Apocalypse Tokens**: Premium currency earned by triggering apocalypses

### Progression
1. **Early Game**: Click to earn chaos, hire departments
2. **Mid Game**: Purchase upgrades, unlock more departments
3. **Late Game**: Trigger apocalypses, unlock mutations, explore scenarios
4. **End Game**: Optimize strategies across multiple prestige layers

### Mutations (Permanent Upgrades)
- **Nuclear Winter**: Start with 10% of previous production
- **AI Optimization**: +25% production permanently
- **Zombie Workforce**: 20% cheaper departments
- **Temporal Loop**: +50% Apocalypse Tokens
- **Cosmic Insight**: Clicking generates chaos based on passive income

## 🎭 Theme

The game combines dark comedy with corporate satire, featuring:
- Absurd department names and descriptions
- "Professional" UI for world-ending activities
- Satirical take on corporate culture meeting doomsday scenarios
- Inspired by games like Cookie Clicker, Universal Paperclips, and NGU Idle
